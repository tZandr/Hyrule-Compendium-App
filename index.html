             Add navigation the same way it's in game(sticky side/bottom?)

             Add a box with complete info that shows when you click an entry.

             Make the search function show the searched info box.

             POST + DELETE in specific entries if possible, if not, then in a sticky header together with the search button.

             Web storage(store the notes, and maybe selected category?)

             Show visuals from chart.js of my data

      <!--
      Idea is to make a website where you can pick your game and search for the ID in the Hyrule Compendium. The response will contain info about the ID and it's whereabouts.
      pages with consist of 24s just like in the game
      header will be sticky with the search function always present
      delete and post will be available instead as notes
      ui is planned to be close to or identical with the game.
