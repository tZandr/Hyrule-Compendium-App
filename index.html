      <!--
      Idea is to make a website where you can pick your game and search for the ID in the Hyrule Compendium. The response will contain info about the ID and it's whereabouts.
      pages with consist of 24s just like in the game
      header will be sticky with the search function always present
      delete and post will be available instead as notes
      ui is planned to be close to or identical with the game.
